To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder ESP8266RGBMatrix. 

Place the ESP8266RGBMatrix library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

You will also have to download the Adafruit GFX Graphics core which does all the circles, text, rectangles, etc. You can get it from
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
and download/install that library as well.
